## 🔀 Challenge 3 — Work with Pull Requests (PRs)

**Goal:** Learn to contribute safely to someone else’s project using a fork and pull request.

### Steps:

1. Find a friend’s public GitHub repository.
2. **Fork** it to your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FRIEND-REPO-NAME.git
   ```
4. Make a small improvement (e.g., fix a typo in `README.md`).
5. Commit and push the change:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix typo in README"
   git push origin main
   ```
6. Go to your fork on GitHub and click **“Compare & pull request.”**
7. Create a pull request with a short explanation of what you changed.
8. Wait for your friend to review and merge your PR.
