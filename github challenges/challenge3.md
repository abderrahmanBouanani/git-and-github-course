Challenge 3 – Work with Pull Requests (PRs)

Goal: Learn how to contribute safely to someone else’s project using forks and PRs.
Tasks:

Find a friend’s public GitHub repository.

Fork their repository to your own GitHub account.

Clone your fork locally and make a small improvement (e.g., fix a typo in README.md).

Commit and push the change to your fork.

Go to your fork on GitHub and click “Compare & pull request.”

Create a pull request describing what you changed and why.

Wait for your friend to review and merge your PR.
